1. What happens when you try to send to a non-IU email address? Why?
* When I try to send an email to a non-IU email address, the request is denied
  because I do not have the proper authentication.
2. What happens when you use a made-up from address? Why?
* When I use a made up address from which to send an email, the email goes
    through nonetheless. I would think that you would not want that to work
    generally speaking. But it was mentioned during the discussion session that
    SMTP does not check to see wheter an email address is valid or not.
